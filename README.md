# This project was done with the help of the tutorial on pathfiding visualization by Tech with Tim on Youtube. I modified the algorithm to use euclidean distance 
# instead of manhattan distance.
- You can right-click any square to make it a start node or end node
- You can left-click any square to make it an obstacle
- You can press SPACE to run A* Pathfiding Algorithm
- You can press RETURN to run Dijkstra's Algorithm
- You can right-click any non-white square to reset it to a white square
